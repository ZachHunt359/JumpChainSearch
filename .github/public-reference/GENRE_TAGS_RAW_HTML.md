<u>Detective Comics:</u> Makers of superhero stories since the 1930s. Most famed for their trademark characters Batman and Superman. In 1985 they famously did a top-down reboot of the whole Universe, the Crisis, to patch over plot holes, nerf Superman and the Green Lanterns and make things more interconnected. If there are any pre-Crisis Jumps, I haven't seen them.<br>

<u>Marvel Comics:</u> Originally Timely Comics, then Atlas. Marvel Comics made it big in the 1960s by releasing titles with far more focus on character and mature themes, with flawed and struggling heroes. It's a formula that has served them well to this day. Best known for Spider-Man &amp; the X-Men, at least previously. In 2009, the company was purchased by Disney. Since '08, they've become the largest name in superhero films with an increasingly vast and interconnected web of movies and shows, the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).<br>
